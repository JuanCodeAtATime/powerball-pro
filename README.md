## Overview

**Powerballer** is a full-stack MERN application that features dynamic, data-driven lottery updates. It features real-time tracking of jackpot amounts and draws. 

Users can enter up to three lottery tickets at a time to compare them with the winning numbers.  The app also features a ticket management tool to view and/or delete past numbers.  

The application currently tracks Powerball lottery games only, but there is a desire to expand this tool to other lottery games.
